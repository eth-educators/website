As of January 15th, 2025, EthStaker has taken over maintaining the [solo staker list](https://github.com/eth-educators/solo-stakers) originally publish by Rated on [May 24th, 2023](https://blog.rated.network/blog/solo-stakers). EthStaker's first update is planned for July 1st, 2025 using Rated's methodology. After this point we expect to update the list quarterly.

The current [solo staker list](https://github.com/eth-educators/solo-stakers) is up to **validator index 1,500,000**. If you are a solo staker with an index below that and not included (check below), feel free to [file a petition](https://forms.gle/YFKFVgq2xdEHS2s26).
