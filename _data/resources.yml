  description: "Previous work has looked into the amount of bond that's necessary for safety assuming various malicious behaviors and assuming various available mitigations. Both of these analyses dramatically underestimate the potential for loss because they assume that the market they've been able to sample is truly representative of the future market. I will show that we already have strong evidence that the EL reward market varies significantly over time. I will use that understanding to estimate some 'clearly' unsafe bond levels."

  description: "For reasons of both safety and liveness, Ethereum has chosen a multi-client architecture. In order to encourage stakers to diversify their setups, penalties are higher for correlated failures. A staker running a minority client will thus typically only lose moderate amounts should their client have a bug, but running a majority client can incur a total loss. Responsible stakers should therefore look at the client landscape and choose a less popular client."

  description: "Ethereum has multiple interoperable clients developed and maintained in different languages by independent teams. This is a major achievement and can provide resilience to the network by limiting the effects of a bug or attack to only the portion of the network running the affected client. However, this strength is only realized if users distribute roughly evenly across the available clients. At present, the vast majority of Ethereum nodes run a single client, inviting unnecessary risk to the network."
