## Best Practice for Future Airdrops

Providing Airdrops to Solo and Home stakers is an excellent way to engage the diverse staking ecosystem built on the Ethereum network. Rewarding solo stakers is a way to connect with some of the most engaged participants in the network, and through their work they've shown that they're willing to get their hands dirty and potentially participate in other projects.


### Do's

- Provide a full list of eligible addresses so users can easily check their eligibilty without connecting or sign
- Recognize that claim days will cause gas spikes and server crashes. Minimize this by simplifying the process as much as possible, claim time isn't a great time for intensive tasks and education.
- Communicate directly with the staking community through blog posts to let them know why you chose to airdrop to them, even if it's just a "thank you", or maybe you're hoping they'll do some action.
- After the airdrop, leave the token locked on the network until the conclusion of the airdrop. This allows the token to be regarded as a "zero cost" airdrop which is advantageous for tax planning in some jurisdictions.
- Allow "claiming on behalf of another address", this means paying for the smart contract cost with a different wallet than the recipient. Many home stakers are EXTREMELY cautious with any keys related to staking, and they'd prefer not to connect those to the network if at all possible.
- Refer to published lists of home stakers like the list maintained by [GLCStaked](https://github.com/GLCNI/ETH-Solo-Validator-Addresses) and the list by [rated.network](https://github.com/rated-network/solo-stakers/tree/main) and rather than developing your own list. This prevents confusion and gives you as the airdropper a direction to refer complaints rather than dealing with frustrated users.
- Reach out to EthStaker or other community leaders before the drop to ensure a smooth process. Use an Non-Disclosure Agreement if necessary.


### Don'ts

- Never use a cap and first-come, first served model to distribute airdrops to a few stakers. This causes a mad frenzy and many angry participants. If you need to cap the number of recipients, use a validator index cutoff, like "all validator indices before 500,000".
- Don't get angry with users who feel frustrated about not getting the drop. Some will complain, re-direct them to the list developer. Use the opportunity to listen and build positive bridges with the home staking community.
